## Agenda for the tech-jam

### Presentation and discussion - 15 minutes (max)

* What is the difference between `Authentication` and `Authorization`
* Different ways of authenticating an API
* Overview of OAuth
* How to choose which authentication method to use for your API
* Code examples - hands-on exercise

### Code examples - 20 x 4 minutes (max)

In this part, we will spend 20 minutes on each of the following types of API authentication - 

* Basic Auth 
* API Key based
* Roll-your-own-JWT 
* OAuth

For each of these cases, we will be focussing on - 

* how it is implemented in code ?
* Pros and Cons of each
* make failing tests pass on your code base

The tech-stack we've used in express/nodejs/jest.
