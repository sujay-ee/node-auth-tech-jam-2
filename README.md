# Tech Jam 2

-   Tech-jam-2 covers the basics of `API authentication`
-   We have chosen `Javascript` and `Typescript` as the programming languages

## What will we be covering

-   We will be covering four important ways in which an API can be authenticated
-   These include
    -   API key authentication
    -   Basic Authentication (email - password based authentication)
    -   JWT Token based authentication
    -   Using OAUTH provider (okta)

## Agenda for the tech-jam

### Presentation and discussion - 15 minutes (max)

* What is the difference between `Authentication` and `Authorization`
* Different ways of authenticating an API
* Overview of OAuth
* How to choose which authentication method to use for your API

### Code examples - 20 x 4 minutes (max) 
For each of the ways, we will be focussing on -

* how it is implemented in code ?
* Pros and Cons of each
* make failing tests pass on your code base
